### 🚀 About Me

I build production-grade systems, not demos.
I focus on clean architecture, scalable backends, and reliable deployments.
I care about correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability.
I’ve shipped full-stack applications used by real users and managed them in production.
I also work as a professional freelance video editor, delivering consistently under real client constraints.

If you want engineering that works in the real world, let’s connect.
